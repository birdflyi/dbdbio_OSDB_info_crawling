BerkeleyDB provides complete ACID compliance through its five subsystems, namely, caching, datastore, locking, logging and recovery. All these five subsystems are implemented using concepts like two-phase locking, undo/redo write-ahead logging, etc. This enables it to offer high performance for a variety of workloads and handle very large-sized key-vale stores (order of Terabytes).

covenantsql,CovenantSQL,"CovenantSQL is a decentralized SQL database management system derived from SQLite and built on top of a blockchain. It supports most of the SQL-92 features.

The block producers maintain a public blockchain (main chain). When a block producer receives a request, it allocates a number of miners. The miners self-organize and produce a separate block chain, called a shard chain. Each miner is an independent database engine running SQLite. CovenantSQL uses Go's driver for SQLite to interact with individual miners. The main chain implements Delegated Proof-of-Stake, which provides eventual consistency among block producers. The block producers pack all SQL queries from clients along with the shard chain's signature into the main block chain. The shard chains themselves consist of database contents and query results. The miners pertaining a shard chain use Byzantine Fault-Toleranted Raft, which provides strong consistency among miners that serve the same client.

It is optimized for time series scans and aggregations. It supports loading data from both deep storage system like HDFS and streaming sources like Kafka. Internally, Druid uses Zookeeper for cluster node coordination, a relational database like MySQL or Postgres to keep track of metadata, and a deep storage system such as HDFS for storing data. Druid also has low latency between the event creation and when it can be queried, which makes Druid desirable for real-time analytics. Druid stores incoming data in a unique format called a segment to allow fast aggregations for arbitrary dimensionalities of data. Druid is commonly used to power GUI-based analytical BI apps via JDBC and as a backend for AI apps via REST API.

duckdb,DuckDB,"DuckDB is a relational embeddable analytical DBMS that focuses on supporting analytical query workloads (OLAP). Similar to SQLite, DuckDB prioritizes simplicity and ease of integration by eliminating external dependencies for compilation and run-time. DuckDB's columnar-vectorized query execution engine reduces the CPU cycles expended per individual value, processing large batches of values in one operation as a vector. This design choice optimizes DuckDB for analytical queries, and in embedded scenarios, it enables high-speed data transfer to and from the database. To provide transactional guarantees (ACID properties), DuckDB employs its custom bulk-optimized multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and enables data to be stored in persistent, single-file databases. Additionally, DuckDB supports secondary indexes to speed up queries trying to find a single table entry.",Relational,,,http://www.duckdb.org/,https://github.com/cwida/duckdb,,CWI,NL,2018.0,,"Academic,Open Source",C++,,,,,@duckdb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ksqldb,ksqlDB,"ksqlDB (Kafka SQL) is a streaming SQL engine that provides SQL interface to the streams in Apache Kafka. It is developed by Confluent Inc. and is built on the Kafka Streams API, which supports joins, aggregations, windowing and sessionization on streaming data. The data is stored in a Kafka cluster, which is a collection of Kafka brokers, segregated into topics. Each topic consists of a defined number of partitions, where each partition is an immutable sequence of messages. KSQL can be used as a library by applications to run SQL queries on top of the stream data stored in the Kafka cluster. As opposed to streaming systems like Spark Streaming which require using Java/Scala for development, KSQL provides a completely interactive, SQL only interface improving the ease of access. KSQL processes one message at a time, making it a true stream processing system instead of a micro-batching system.

Kyoto Cabinet is a successor and modern implementation of UNIX DBM by AT&T in 1979. It provides different object-oriented database implementations, which differ in whether using Hash Table or B+ Tree, or whether enabling cache. They are,BasicDB,(common interface),ProtoHashDB,(on-memory hash database),ProtoTreeDB,(on-memory tree database),StashDB,(lightweight on-memory hash database with cache),CacheDB,(on-memory database with LRU cache),GrassDB,(on-memory tree database with cache),HashDB,(file hash database),TreeDB,(file tree database),DirDB,(directory hash database),ForestDB,(directory tree database),TestDB,(text database) and,PolyDB,(polymorphic database). All of the implementations in Kyoto Cabinet support inserting, deleting and query operations. Moreover, the B+ Tree based implementations also support traversal operation. The file size for each record in Kyoto Cabinet can take either 4KB or 16KB space, based on whether using B+ Tree or Hash Table, and the total database size can be up to 8EB.",,"Custom API,Command-line / Shell",,http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/,https://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/pkg/,http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/api/,FAL Labs,JP,2009.0,,Open Source,C++,,,,"BSD,Linux,OS X,Solaris,Windows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MySQL has been actively updated and supported since 1995, with new versions being released every 1-3 years.

It's also possible for Pinot to dynamically merge data streams that come from both offline and online. Pinot divides tables into segments, which are immutable sets of tuples. Tuples inside each segment are organized in columnar manner. Segments are basic units in Pinot. In server nodes, data from Kafka and Hadoop / HDFS are processed and cached as segments. They store metadata, indexes, and necessary zone maps for their tuples. Storage optimizations are applied inside each segment; Indexes are built for each segment. Query plans and optimizations are also generated and performed on a per-segment basis. An internal building block of Pinot is Apache Helix. It's used to manage the cluster such as replicas and redundant nodes.

tiledb,TileDB,"TileDB is an embedded storage engine designed to support the storage and access of both dense and sparse multi-dimensional arrays. The key idea of TileDB is that it stores array elements into collections called fragments, which can be either dense or sparse. Each of these fragments stores data in data tiles. In the case of dense fragments, the capacity of data tiles is limited by a fixed chunk size. In the case of sparse fragments, the capacity of data tiles is limited by a fixed element size. TileDB also supports parallel I/O and is completely multi-threaded. TileDB is designed to store many different types of data, such as genomic data, machine learning model parameters, imaging data, and LiDaR data. TileDB Inc. also has a cloud offering called TileDB Cloud SaaS, which is a closed-source offering of TileDB with additional features, such as serverless UDFs and task graphs to build custom workflows of TileDB tasks.

Tokyo Cabinet supports concurrent access. It also implements a thin ""table"" abstraction which simulates columns over a key-value store and transactions with ACID properties and write-ahead logging. The key-value storage layer is built on top of three fundamental data structures: (1) a static hash table with separate chaining (every bucket is a binary search tree), (2) a non-concurrent B+ tree, and, (3) a fixed-size array.
