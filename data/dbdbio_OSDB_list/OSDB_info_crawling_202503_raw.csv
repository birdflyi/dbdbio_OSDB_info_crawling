All these five subsystems are implemented using concepts like two-phase locking, undo/redo write-ahead logging, etc. This enables it to offer high performance for a variety of workloads and handle very large-sized key-vale stores (order of Terabytes).

The number and sizes of the stratified samples are limited by the storage budget specified when importing the data. It has two major parts: one is the sample building engine that selects what stratified samples to build by considering historic workloads and the distribution of the data; the other part is a dynamic sample selection module that chooses appropriate sample files at runtime according to specific time/accuracy requirements specified by the query. BlinkDB has a public open source repository on Github. The latest version number is alpha-0.2.0. However, its features are quite limited.

The block producers maintain a public blockchain (main chain). When a block producer receives a request, it allocates a number of miners. The miners self-organize and produce a separate block chain, called a shard chain. Each miner is an independent database engine running SQLite. CovenantSQL uses Go's driver for SQLite to interact with individual miners. The main chain implements Delegated Proof-of-Stake, which provides eventual consistency among block producers. The block producers pack all SQL queries from clients along with the shard chain's signature into the main block chain. The shard chains themselves consist of database contents and query results. The miners pertaining a shard chain use Byzantine Fault-Toleranted Raft, which provides strong consistency among miners that serve the same client.

The data is stored in a Kafka cluster, which is a collection of Kafka brokers, segregated into topics. Each topic consists of a defined number of partitions, where each partition is an immutable sequence of messages. KSQL can be used as a library by applications to run SQL queries on top of the stream data stored in the Kafka cluster. As opposed to streaming systems like Spark Streaming which require using Java/Scala for development, KSQL provides a completely interactive, SQL only interface improving the ease of access.

Tuples inside each segment are organized in columnar manner. Segments are basic units in Pinot. In server nodes, data from Kafka and Hadoop / HDFS are processed and cached as segments. They store metadata, indexes, and necessary zone maps for their tuples. Storage optimizations are applied inside each segment; Indexes are built for each segment. Query plans and optimizations are also generated and performed on a per-segment basis. An internal building block of Pinot is Apache Helix.

In the case of dense fragments, the capacity of data tiles is limited by a fixed chunk size. In the case of sparse fragments, the capacity of data tiles is limited by a fixed element size. TileDB also supports parallel I/O and is completely multi-threaded. TileDB is designed to store many different types of data, such as genomic data, machine learning model parameters, imaging data, and LiDaR data. TileDB Inc. also has a cloud offering called TileDB Cloud SaaS, which is a closed-source offering of TileDB with additional features, such as serverless UDFs and task graphs to build custom workflows of TileDB tasks.

This is due to the fact that there is virtually no transaction delay between physical I/O so XAP can be applied to distributed applications ranging from financial services to retail.

xtdb,XTDB,"XTDB is an bitemporal document DBMS that uses Apache Kafka for the primary storage of transactions and documents, and RocksDB or LMDB to host indexes for rich query support. Its bitemporal support allows the system to store and query data on two different factors, valid time and system time. XTDB does not enforce any schema for the documents it stores. It supports a Datalog query interface for reading data and traversing relationships across all documents, where queries are executed so that the results are lazily streamed. Additionally, even though the main transaction log is immutable, XTDB still supports the eviction of active as well as historical data.",Document / XML,"SQL,Datalog",Shared-Disk,https://xtdb.com/,https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb,https://xtdb.com/docs/,JUXT,GB,2018,,"Commercial,Open Source",Clojure,"Clojure,Java","LMDB,RocksDB",MIT,,Document,Y,xtdb/xtdb,xtdb,xtdb,Y

zodb,ZODB,"The Zope Object Database (ZODB, ZopeDB) is an object-oriented DBMS library for storing Python objects. ZODB aims to provide a transparent way for Python programmers to make their data persistent. It is completely written by Python, and only provides Python API. It does not support other programming languages. ZODB stores data as objects, and the relationship between objects are automatically maintained by Python object references. As a result, ZODB allows programmers to manage data structures with complicate relationships. The storage layer of ZODB is pluggable, and there are three main implementations: ZEO, NEO, and RelStorage. ZEO is a single-server client-server framework using FileStorage as the backend; NEO extends ZEO to distributed-server client-server storage; RelStorage stores objects in a relational database backend, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. ZODB uses aggressive caching. As a result, it is not suitable for tasks with heavy writes. Also, ZODB is mainly designed for mapping access through keys and attributes of objects, which means that it does not support queries containing joins and advanced search.",Object-Oriented,Custom API,Shared-Everything,http://www.zodb.org/,https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZODB,http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/reference/index.html,Zope Foundation,US,2002,,Open Source,Python,Python,,Zope Public License,,Object oriented,Y,zopefoundation/ZODB,zopefoundation,ZODB,Y
