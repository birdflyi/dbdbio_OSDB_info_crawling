BerkeleyDB provides complete ACID compliance through its five subsystems, namely, caching, datastore, locking, logging and recovery. All these five subsystems are implemented using concepts like two-phase locking, undo/redo write-ahead logging, etc. This enables it to offer high performance for a variety of workloads and handle very large-sized key-vale stores (order of Terabytes).

covenantsql,CovenantSQL,"CovenantSQL is a decentralized SQL database management system derived from SQLite and built on top of a blockchain. It supports most of the SQL-92 features. Each party interacting with CovenantSQL is either a client, a block producer, or a miner: When a client sends a connection request, the request is directed to one node among a group of block producers. The block producers maintain a public blockchain (main chain). When a block producer receives a request, it allocates a number of miners. The miners self-organize and produce a separate block chain, called a shard chain. Each miner is an independent database engine running SQLite. CovenantSQL uses Go's driver for SQLite to interact with individual miners. The main chain implements Delegated Proof-of-Stake, which provides eventual consistency among block producers. The block producers pack all SQL queries from clients along with the shard chain's signature into the main block chain. The shard chains themselves consist of database contents and query results. The miners pertaining a shard chain use Byzantine Fault-Toleranted Raft, which provides strong consistency among miners that serve the same client.

duckdb,DuckDB,"DuckDB is a Relational Embeddable Analytical DBMS that focuses on supporting analytical query workloads (OLAP) while embedded within another process. Similar to SQLite, DuckDB prioritizes simplicity and ease of integration by eliminating external dependencies for compilation and run-time. DuckDB's columnar-vectorized query execution engine reduces the CPU cycles expended per individual value, processing large batches of values in one operation as a vector. This design choice optimizes DuckDB for analytical queries, and in embedded scenarios, it enables high-speed data transfer to and from the database.

Kyoto Cabinet is a successor and modern implementation of UNIX DBM by AT&T in 1979. It provides different object-oriented database implementations, which differ in whether using Hash Table or B+ Tree, or whether enabling cache. They are,BasicDB,(common interface),ProtoHashDB,(on-memory hash database),ProtoTreeDB,(on-memory tree database),StashDB,(lightweight on-memory hash database with cache),CacheDB,(on-memory database with LRU cache),GrassDB,(on-memory tree database with cache),HashDB,(file hash database),TreeDB,(file tree database),DirDB,(directory hash database),ForestDB,(directory tree database),TestDB,(text database) and,PolyDB,(polymorphic database). All of the implementations in Kyoto Cabinet support inserting, deleting and query operations. Moreover, the B+ Tree based implementations also support traversal operation. The file size for each record in Kyoto Cabinet can take either 4KB or 16KB space, based on whether using B+ Tree or Hash Table, and the total database size can be up to 8EB.",Key/Value,"Custom API,Command-line / Shell",,http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/,https://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/pkg/,http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/api/,FAL Labs,JP,2009.0,,Open Source,C++,,,GPL v3,,,,,,,,,,"Disk-oriented,In-Memory",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's also possible for Pinot to dynamically merge data streams that come from both offline and online. Pinot divides tables into segments, which are immutable sets of tuples. Tuples inside each segment are organized in columnar manner. Segments are basic units in Pinot. In server nodes, data from Kafka and Hadoop / HDFS are processed and cached as segments. They store metadata, indexes, and necessary zone maps for their tuples. Storage optimizations are applied inside each segment; Indexes are built for each segment. Query plans and optimizations are also generated and performed on a per-segment basis. An internal building block of Pinot is Apache Helix. It's used to manage the cluster such as replicas and redundant nodes.

swc-db,SWC-DB,"SWC-DB (""Super Wide Column Database"") is a wide-column DBMS. SWC-DB does not have Tables nor Namespaces; the number of columns is numerous with a support of a selector over column name and tags, the actual Key is a structure of Fractions and binary(bytes) data is supported by the Cell's (record's) Key or Value. SWC-DB can be described as key-value store model with support of numerous Fractions makeup the Key. Like the wide-column database known to support of a single column-qualifier the Key-Fractions in SWC-DB let use of 2^24 qualifiers(-1 ""row"") for a single record-key that consist the joined fractions. A Fraction limit is 2^24 in length and total key is 2^32 bytes. Regardless the key-value store as perception SWC-DB like wide-column databases has support for scanning and selecting cells on intervals, the extended support of scan includes scanning of multiple Columns with multiple Intervals in a Column. The master & meta columns in SWC-DB (the range locators system-columns) index/store additionally to the key-begin and key-end of a range, the minimal and maximum values of the fractions in an aligned manner that tackle the range-locator latency and access/scan multi-dimensional key letting to select F(N) without the need for scanning F(0). SWC-DB like no other database has support for several key-sequences, the column schema define the key byte sequence options Lexical (0,1,10,9) or Volumetric (0,1,9,10) or over Fractions-Count in a key (less to more). The Cell Value in SWC-DB is defined in column schema and current column-type options are PLAIN, SERIAL and COUNTER_(I8,I16,I32,I64). The possibilities of scanning over value-data depends on the column-type. All the conditions of Cell's key, Cell's value, Column's name and Column's tag with SWC-DB are done with types of Comparators that are extended to domain-object types such as partially/fully order sup/subset plus extension to volumetric on lexical.

Its bitemporal support allows the system to store and query data on two different factors, valid time and system time. XTDB does not enforce any schema for the documents it stores. It supports a Datalog query interface for reading data and traversing relationships across all documents, where queries are executed so that the results are lazily streamed. Additionally, even though the main transaction log is immutable, XTDB still supports the eviction of active as well as historical data.",Document / XML,"SQL,Datalog",Shared-Disk,https://xtdb.com/,https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb,https://xtdb.com/docs/,JUXT,GB,2018,,"Commercial,Open Source",Clojure,"Clojure,Java",,MIT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,@xtdb_com,,,,,,Crux,,

zodb,ZODB,"The Zope Object Database (ZODB, ZopeDB) is an object-oriented DBMS library for storing Python objects. ZODB aims to provide a transparent way for Python programmers to make their data persistent. It is completely written by Python, and only provides Python API. It does not support other programming languages. ZODB stores data as objects, and the relationship between objects are automatically maintained by Python object references. As a result, ZODB allows programmers to manage data structures with complicate relationships. The storage layer of ZODB is pluggable, and there are three main implementations: ZEO, NEO, and RelStorage. ZEO is a single-server client-server framework using FileStorage as the backend; NEO extends ZEO to distributed-server client-server storage; RelStorage stores objects in a relational database backend, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. ZODB uses aggressive caching. As a result, it is not suitable for tasks with heavy writes. Also, ZODB is mainly designed for mapping access through keys and attributes of objects, which means that it does not support queries containing joins and advanced search.",Object-Oriented,Custom API,Shared-Everything,http://www.zodb.org/,https://github.com/zopefoundation/ZODB,http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/reference/index.html,Zope Foundation,US,2002,,Open Source,Python,Python,,Zope Public License,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope_Object_Database,,,,,
